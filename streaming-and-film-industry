# Streaming and the Film Industry:
  Impact of streaming on film industry
    The streaming industry has changed the perspective of audiences by giving them a variety of shows, movies, and web series at the same price as a movie ticket.
    As a result, people now have started to binge-watch a lot and now it has become common among youngsters.
    Before COVID-19, people often used to watch movies in theaters, but nowadays the craze for movies has changed from theaters to OTT platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, etc.
    The figure of people to watch a movie first in theater has decreased from 28% in 2018 to only 14%.
