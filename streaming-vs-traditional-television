Streaming vs. Traditional Television
      How Streaming has led to a decline in traditional television.
        
  1. Cord-cutting and the Decline of Cable TV
    Cord-cutting is believed to be the phenomenon that caused people to unsubscribe from their cable television.
    The main cause of this phenomenon is the worth delivered by streaming services as compared to cable services. 
    Freedom of choice is also one of the main reasons why new customers are enrolling in streaming services 
    over Cable TVs.
    
  2. Personalization and Content Discovery
      Cable Televisions were not tailored for different users simultaneously.
      What makes Streaming services different from cable television in terms of personalization:
      * Tailored Content Experience: 
            Streaming Platforms excel in personalization, using algorithms to analyze viewing habits and provide tailored recommendations.
      * Endless Content Libraries: 
            Cabled Television also has endless shows but most of them are repeated and not very updated. 

  3. The Role of Advertisements
      * Ad-free Viewing: 
            The users are given the option to stream without any advertisements, this is the complete opposite of traditional cable television.
      * Subscription Based Revenue Model: 
            Streaming services primarily rely on subscription fees as their revenue source.

  4. Original Content Production
      In the beginning, streaming services used to provide already existing media from other players.
      Lately, streaming platforms have started to produce their own content which includes movies, web series, and shows. 
      Also, there are many shows which have won some awards as well.
