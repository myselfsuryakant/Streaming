# The Technology Behind Streaming
  # Understanding Data Transmission
    How Streaming works?
    1. Data Compression: High-quality video and audio files can be quite large in size. 
      To facilitate smooth streaming over the internet, these files are first compressed to reduce their size. 
      Several file formats and codecs are used for this purpose.

    2. Breaking down the files: After compression, the files are then broken down into smaller packets of data. 
      This breakdown enables the distribution of content over the internet in a more efficient manner.

    3. Transmission: The small packets of data are then sent over the internet from the server (which hosts the file) to the client device (the user's computer or mobile gadget). 
      This transmission typically uses a protocol such as TCP/IP or UDP.

    4. Buffering: The client device receives the data packets and starts to buffer them. Buffering is a process where a portion of the file is pre-loaded before playback. 
      This prevention aims to ensure continuous play, even when there's a slight delay in receiving the next set of data packets.

    5. Decoding and Playing: Once a sufficient amount of data is buffered, your device begins to decode the data packets and output the file through your video player or music player. 
      The data continues to stream in real-time, allowing you to view or listen to the content as it arrives.

    6. Adjusting Quality: Most streaming services have a feature that adjusts the quality of the content based on your internet connection speed. 
      If the speed is high, you'll get high-quality content; if it's low, the service will adjust and send lower quality content to ensure continuous playback.


  # Live-Streaming vs. On-demand Streaming:
    Live Streaming: Live streaming is a real-time transmission of audio, video, or both over the internet. 
      With live streaming, as the events occur, they are broadcast over the internet for viewers to watch in real-time. 
      Live streaming can be interactive, allowing viewers to respond or react to the content as it happens. 
      This form of streaming has become particularly popular with live events, such as sports, concerts, webinars, or TV shows, where sharing the experience in the moment is important.
      Examples may include: Facebook live, Intagram Live, Youtube Live, Twicth

  - On-Demand Streaming: It allows users to access pre-recorded audio or video files at their leisure. 
      Unlike broadcasting or live streaming, the content doesn't have a set start time. Instead, users can start, pause, stop, or replay the content according to their own schedule.
      Examples may include Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and even YouTube.
